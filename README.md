Responsive Design: Fully responsive UI with TailwindCSS to ensure it works well across devices.
Modern State Management: Uses Redux and React-Redux for efficient state management.
Animations: Beautiful animations and transitions powered by Framer Motion.
Routing: React Router is used to manage navigation across the app.
